[Challenge description](https://github.com/payvision-development/recruitment-challenges/tree/fullstack-engineer)

# Webapp

This repository contains a client web application implemented on Angular 7.3.3 as a part of the challenge solution. To see _High Level System_ description go [here](./../README.md)

# Commands

**NPM** is the application dependency manager. To run application lifecycle tasks, run from current directory:

| command | description |
| :----- | :------- |
| `npm start` | Run application in dev mode |
| `npm run start:prod` | Run application in prod mode |
| `npm build` | Build application |
| `npm run lint` | Run lint checks |
| `npm test` | Run unit tests |
| `npm run e2e` | Run end to end tests |

# Webapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
